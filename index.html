    <h1>This is a page header.</h1>
    <p>
      Here is a chunk of text that describes what this website would be about,
      whether its for a business or a more personal use. Adding more words to
      take up more space.
    </p>

    <h2>Here's a subheading.</h2>
    <p>
      Here's where I would go into more details about what the website is about.
      Since its about nothing right now, I'll just write about nothing.
      Sometimes nothing is nice.

      Now I'll just ramble about whatever. I can't wait until I have money to
      buy a place for myself. Then I'll get a cat. I feel like a cat could heal
      all my problems.
