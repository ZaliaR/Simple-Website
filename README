I'm still not confident with how to use links and images, so that I think will be my biggest issue.

The "Go Live" feature isn't working, so I used CodePen. It looks like everything works except I still don't know how to put that link under the image. Or it could be a CodePen issue, I really don't know. I wish the Go Live feature worked :C
